    Custom Facets: Missing tests. Grammar should work
    Array
        uniqueItems How do we validate uniques in object and arrays. Where is the comparison defined???
    Object
        required property in grammar supports not only ?
        Discriminator
        DiscriminatorValue

    XmlSchema validator this does not look ok
      if (this.type != null && !value.trim().startsWith("<" + this.type))
        {
            node.replaceWith(ErrorNodeFactory.createInvalidXmlExampleNode("Provided object is not of type " + this.type));
        }


Move error node factory to impl???

Split beteween framework and implementations

Declaring the type of a property to be null represents the lack of a value in a type instance. In a RAML context that requires values of type null (vs just type declarations), the usual YAML null is used, e.g. when the type is null | number you may use enum: [ 1, 2, ~ ] or more explicitly/verbosely enum: [ 1, 2, !!null "" ]; in non-inline notation you can just omit the value completely, of course.

Model
    Example is model as string what should we do with complex example written in Yaml???

Multiple Inheritance
    - how facets are being merge between elements
    - What does it mean to be compatible???
